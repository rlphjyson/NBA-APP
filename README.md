Project Name: NBA Tracker <br />
Description: Since I loved to watch NBA and always tuned in to every games, I made an application to see player details and team details. <br />
This is an application where you can see details from All NBA players and NBA teams provided by https://www.balldontlie.io API  <br />

Disclaimer: Player Screen does take a long time to load because I get all 5000 players from the API whice takes about 52 request before it completes the list of players.
The API also doesnt provide images for players and teams, but for the teams, Since there's only 30 nba teams, I provided an image for every team. <br />

API: 
get players: https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/players

get teams: https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/teams

Project Setup:
first, Clone the repository into your device:
Repository link: https://github.com/rlphjyson/Theoria-exam.git

After you cloned the repository, open it on VSCODE. 

Once you opened it, you want to make sure that you're inside the 'nbatracker' directory, to do this just type 'cd nbatracker' on the terminal.

Once you're inside the nbatracker directory, just type 'flutter pub get' to the terminal to get all dependencies,

After you get all the dependencies, type 'flutter run' to run it on your local device.

you can choose whichever os you want to use, but I highly suggest to run it on chrome or android simulator, (if you run it on chrome, you can change the orientation to mobile by going to the console and selecting the mobile icon on the upper left of the console).
